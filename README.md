# Multiplication Trainer

A simple program, to motivate you to do your time tables

## CLI

The CLI is very simple (for now), it only takes one optional number, which limits the multiplicand to that value

## Why?

During the pandemic, my times tables got noticably rusty, and I could not find any interactive ways to practice, and randomly generated workbooks seemed a bit too much. So in my spare time I wrote this script
